# Forest Fire Analysis and Visualization

---

## 📌 Overview 

This project analyzes and visualizes forest fire data using Python. It includes data preprocessing, correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, geographical mapping, and K-Means clustering on fire locations.

---
## 📂 Dataset

The dataset (forestfires.csv) contains information about forest fires, including environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and fire size.

---
## 🚀 Features

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Missing values, dataset overview

✔️ Correlation Heatmap – Finding relationships between variables

✔️ Scatter Plots – Understanding how weather factors influence fire size

✔️ Geographical Fire Map – Visualizing fire locations using Folium

✔️ Graph Comparisons – Effect of temperature & rainfall on fire size
